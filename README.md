Video Streaming Management System
This is a project I created for my Object-Oriented Programming class. The goal was to design and implement a system to manage different types of videos, including movies and series with episodes, using key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, method overloading/overriding, and abstract classes.

What it does
Loads movies and series data (with episodes) from text files.

Allows users to view videos filtered by rating or genre.

Shows episodes of a specific series with a minimum rating.

Lets users add ratings to movies or individual episodes.

Demonstrates use of advanced OOP features like operator overloading and exception handling.

Technologies and concepts
Written in C++

Uses classes, inheritance, and polymorphism

Applies encapsulation with proper access modifiers

Implements abstract base classes and overrides methods

Overloads operators in custom classes

Handles user input validation and exceptions

How to run
Compile all the .cpp files together.

Make sure the data files (series_and_episodes.txt and BaseDeDatos_Peliculas.txt) are in the same folder.

Run the executable and follow the menu options.

File format example
series_and_episodes.txt contains series and episode data including ratings.

BaseDeDatos_Peliculas.txt contains movie data including ratings.

About me
Iâ€™m currently studying Robotics Engineering and Digital Systems, and this project helped me improve my understanding of OOP principles while practicing C++ programming.
